## General Information
### The objective of this assignment is to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
####The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
- How well those variables describe the price of a house.


### This project includes
- Reading and Understanding the Data
- Cleaning and Preparing the Data
- Visualising Data through graphs
- Splitting the data for training and testing
- Scaling the Features
- Building Models (Linear, Ridge & Lasso)
- Residual Analysis of the training data
- Making Predictions Using the Final Model
- Model Evaluation
- Conclusion on the features most contributing towards explaining the target



### Conclusions
<b>Following are the top 5 features contributing significantly:</b>
<ul>1. <b>GrLivArea</b> (Above grade (ground) living area square feet)</ul>
<ul>2. <b>RoofMatl</b> (Wood Shingles for Roof material)</ul>
<ul>3. <b>OverallQual</b> (Very Excellent & Excellent Rate for the overall material and finish of the house)</ul>
<ul>4. <b>Neighborhood</b> (Northridge for Physical locations within Ames city limits)</ul>
<ul>5. <b>GarageCars</b> (Size of garage in car capacity)</ul>
